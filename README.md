# Crop_Prediction
# INTRODUCTION
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. Precision agriculture is a 
modern farming technique that uses the data of soil characteristics, soil 
types, crop yield data, weather conditions and suggests the farmers with 
the most optimal crop to grow in their farms for maximum yield and 
profit. This technique can reduce the crop failures and will help the 
farmers to take informed decision about their farming strategy.
Advancement in area of machine learning has helped improving gains in 
agriculture. Machine learning is the current technology which is 
benefiting farmers to minimize the losses in the farming by providing 
rich recommendations and insights about the crops.
# OBJECTIVE
To recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on 
several parameters and help them make an informed decision before 
cultivation.
# MODELS TESTED:
• Decision Tree


• Gaussian Naïve Bayes



• Logistic Regression

# CONCLUSION
In this project we have done a study to evaluate the use of machine 
learning techniques to predict the most optimal crop to grow based on 
the inputs of temperature, rainfall, humidity and soil data.
For better understanding of the data and correlation of the features, data 
was visualized using Frequency Distributions, Heat Maps & count plots.
To discover the best model to achieve the objective of the project, a set 
of machine learning techniques were implemented, including Logistic 
Regression, Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes, being the results compared.
We have tested each model based on different model evaluation 
parameters. Results have shown that Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree
achieve the best efficiency, after cross validation. And we have chosen 
the better one out of the two based on the accuracy results, Naïve Bayes 
has been chosen for the prediction model.
